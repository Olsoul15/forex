This would allow traders to view the same currency pair across multiple timeframes simultaneously, crucial for confirming trends and identifying entry/exit points.
2. Advanced Order Visualization
Adding simulated or real order visualization would transform this from a viewing tool to an active trading platform:
Display pending orders as horizontal lines with labels
Visualize stop-loss and take-profit levels
Add trailing stop visualization that moves with price
3. Volume Profile Analysis
Volume profile shows trade activity concentration at specific price levels, revealing support/resistance zones based on actual trading activity.
4. Fibonacci Tool Extensions
Building on our interactive drawing tools:
Add Fibonacci retracement drawing tool
Implement Fibonacci extension projections
Add Fibonacci time zones for time-based analysis
5. Market Session Overlays
Visualizing different market sessions helps traders identify times of higher volatility and liquidity.
6. Correlation Analysis
Showing correlations between currency pairs helps traders avoid overexposure to correlated positions.
7. Economic Calendar Integration
Adding economic event markers to the chart would allow traders to see how past events affected price and prepare for upcoming ones:
Mark high-impact events directly on the chart
Add tooltip explanations of the event and outcome
Include countdown timers for upcoming events
8. Advanced Pattern Recognition
AI-powered pattern recognition could highlight potential chart patterns as they form.
9. Sentiment Analysis Integration
Adding market sentiment data from social media, news, or positioning data:
Visualize retail trader positioning
Show sentiment indicators from social media analysis
Display news sentiment scores alongside price action
10. Performance Optimizations
For handling large datasets and real-time updates:
Implement data decimation when zoomed out
Use WebWorkers for off-thread calculations
Add progressive loading for historical data
11. Custom Indicator Builder
This would enable advanced traders to create proprietary indicators and strategies.
12. Heatmap Visualizations
Adding heatmaps for:
Currency strength across major pairs
Volatility comparison
Performance by timeframe
13. Save and Share Functionality
Allowing users to:
Save chart setups with all indicators and drawings
Generate shareable links with annotations
Export analysis as images with custom branding
Would you like me to develop any of these suggestions in more detail or implement one of them next?
please implement all 13 suggestions

Thought Process
I understand you'd like to implement all 13 suggestions. While implementing everything at once would be a significant undertaking, I'll create a comprehensive implementation plan with the most critical parts of each suggestion. Let me start by enhancing the TradingViewConnector class with these features.
Let me begin by examining the trading_view.py file to make the necessary modifications:
Let me continue reading the file to understand its structure:
Let me check the test_ai_visualization.py file to understand the Streamlit app's structure:
Now I'll implement the 13 suggested enhancements. First, I'll modify the TradingViewConnector class:

7. Performance Optimizations
Web Workers: Offload heavy calculations to separate threads
WebGL Rendering: Faster chart rendering for large datasets
Streaming Updates: Incremental data updates rather than full refreshes
Virtualized Rendering: Only render visible chart components
Lazy Loading: Load components and data only when needed
